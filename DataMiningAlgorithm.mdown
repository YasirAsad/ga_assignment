The name of the Algorithm I read was Apriori
It solves the problem of Association.
the Algorithm basically looks at if and else conditions and stores the number of frequency the condition is met. once its done , It can calculate the probability of an item present just by looking at the antecedent.
This algorithm can be widely usued in online marketing where recommendations can be made for purchase upon selecting an specified item.
In a cosmetics facory setting , this algorithm can be applied to predict mechanic downtime issues with unique packiging. If there is a type of cap that causes issues on two or three pieces of equipment or a certain type of jar causing downtimes on other pieces of equipment. we can use this algorithm to calculate the probablity of equipment downtime based on packaging profile.
Also in a factory setting , as assoication can be made in the tool crib where we can determing the tools that have a high probaility of being used at the same time to be stored in a close proximity to save time for the mechanics to be able to acquire tools in a timely fashion.
